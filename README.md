# DOB-Wordlist
DOB Wordlist of 8 digits from 1900-2099
This is created with crunch by this code

$ crunch 8 8 0123456789 -s stringstart -e stringend -o DOB_List.txt

stringstart means you should define a start number
example: crunch 8 8 0123456789 -s 31121900 -e 31122099 -o 3112.txt

similarly stringend means you should define end number

To Create this word list you should have lot of patience

I created this by running code 366 time i.e for every single date

---By using this wordlist you can crack every type of DOB Passwords---
